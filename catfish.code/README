DESCRIPTION
 
  Program numerically solves PDE of Adsorption-modified Gierer-Meinhardt model
  with Neuman boundary conditions. 

  Reaction and diffusion terms are computed sequentially. We use Runge-Kutta
  scheme for the reaction part. ADI technique coupled with flux sweeping algorithm 
  is used for solving two-dimensional diffusion problem.

  For the details see (Nesterenko et. al, 2016 [in progress]). Please cite
  this paper if you use the code.

 
INSTALLATION NOTES

  Just run make. No special libraries are required.

  The code can be compiled under any POSIX compiler. If using ICC instead of GCC
  one should modify flags in the Makefile. This code can also be compiled under
  win32/win64 environment (MINGW-GCC).
